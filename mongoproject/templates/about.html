    <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
      <p>Data is growing and moving faster than healthcare organizations can ingest it. The amount of data generated by the various EMR systems, Claims, medical, etc. are larger in size compared to traditional data. The speed of healthcare data created from patient encounters and patient monitors is increasing, in and out of the clinic.
Data in healthcare is huge and it can be structured or unstructured accordingly. Structured data, as the name suggests, is information that can be stored and displayed in a consistent, organized manner. Examples of health data that would fall into this category include numerical values like height, weight and blood pressure, as well as categorical values like blood type or ordinal values like the stages of disease diagnosis. Unstructured data, on the other hand, lacks the organization and precision of structured data. Examples in this category include physician notes, x-ray images and even faxed copies of structured data.
 However, it is observed that majorly medical data resides in unstructured formats, such as doctors’ notes, images, and charts from monitoring instruments. Thus we aim at constructing a generic data model using MongoDB which is a type of unstructured database, thereby performing segregation of the unstructured data and structured data in the field of healthcare.
Our project majorly aims to promise for a better quality of medical results, as well as reducing time, needed to up-to-date healthcare data and sorting medical data in a logical structure along with accessing and retrieving patient’s historical data fast and smoothly.
